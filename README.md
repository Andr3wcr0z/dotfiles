# Linux (Kubuntu)

## Here are most of my configurations!

# I use Doom Emacs for studying at the moment.


### I use both Vim and Neovim

### Each have their own purposes (although very similar, different)
- **Neovim serves as a code editor for me when I'm going to code for a prolonged period of time**

# MacOS
