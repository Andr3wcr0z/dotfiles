### I use both Vim and Neovim

Each have their own purposes (although very similar, different)
- Neovim serves as a code editor for me when I'm going to code for a prolonged period of time
- Vim also serves as a code editor for me. The only difference being that I only use nvim for when I'm going to be quick.
